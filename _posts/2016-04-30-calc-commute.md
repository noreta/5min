One of NYC's favorite pasttimes is picking an optimal commute route, based on time, amount of walking, number of transfers, and some other trivial things.

I was looking for hopstop (used this 6 years ago), but it doesn't exist anymore. Citymapper popped up in search results so I took a peek. Super awesome UI features.

I looked up more information about this company to get an idea of how they create this product. 

Their blog: [From A to (series) B](https://medium.com/@Citymapper/getting-from-a-to-series-b-883393164276#.rhopijmn0)

Their software engineer job posting describes, "We use a lot of Python and some C++ and Java" and their map and commute data comes from GTFS and OpenStreetMap.
