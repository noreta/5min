Today I started reading Chapter 1 of [Haskell Programming From First Principles][1] in preparation for [the study group][2] coming up later in the month.

In chapter 1 some big words appear. I ask about these in the slack channel, and we came up with some jokes that helped me remember what they mean.

Say you're at <strike>walmart</strike> Targ&eacute;t, checking out. Here's what these terms mean analogically:

**Alpha Equivalence**: "excuse me, is coupon A alpha equivalent to coupon B for this shampoo?"

**Beta Reduction**: applying coupon discount to the price. "You beta reduce this coupon into the price"
