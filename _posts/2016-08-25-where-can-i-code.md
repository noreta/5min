Started a map with a plot of various coding places around South Brooklyn. Google maps is really useful :smile: I love how I can separate different layers. Will make use of colors someday when I have more information to filter but for now just having the two layers is useful.

Wanted to share this map to encourage folks to continue recommending places, let's support our local coffee shops!

I can be reached on twitter, so please let me know if you have suggestions.
