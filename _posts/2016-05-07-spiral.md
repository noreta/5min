Here's the whole solution in haskell: 

{% highlight haskell %}

data Direction = Up | Right' | Left' | Down

move (x, y) direction = case direction of
     Up -> (x, y+1)
     Down -> (x, y-1)
     Right' -> (x+1, y)
     Left' -> (x-1, y)

turn d = case d of
  Up -> Right'
  Down -> Left'
  Right' -> Down
  Left' -> Up

incrGoal d s g
  | s < g = incrGoal d (s+1) g
  | otherwise d = turn d

step (x, y) n taken
    | taken <= n = step (x, y) n (taken + 1)
    | otherwise = return ((x,y), taken)
    where goal = 1

-- function that checks for direction change
--
step_level taken goal direction = "up"


spiral n
  | n == 0 = []
  | n == 1 = [(0, 0)]
  | n == 2 = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]
  | otherwise = take n b
  where b = [(1, 1), (0, 1)]

{% endhighlight %}
