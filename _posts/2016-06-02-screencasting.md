Practiced screencasting as it's a skill I want to get better at. Went with showing off some chrome features as a way to get used to Quicktime's software for screen recordings.

#### Recording with quicktime

The first time I recorded, I forgot to turn on the mic. I also couldn't find the stop button. But then on the 2nd try I figured out the settings and found the stop button. Smoother but still could use a lot more improvements for the future. I'm ok with the quality for now as a quick run through to familiarize with the techniques.

I think next time instead of the full screen I'm going to focus on a smaller screen area so that the text is clearer.
