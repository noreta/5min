Today I found out that haskell comes with a feature for splitting lists. It comes in the base package ([link][1])

{% highlight haskell %}
splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
{% endhighlight %}

The description says:

`splitAt n xs` returns a tuple where first element is `xs` prefix of length `n` and second element is the remainder of the list:
 
It is equivalent to `(take n xs, drop n xs)` when n is not `_|_ (splitAt _|_ xs = _|_)`. `splitAt` is an instance of the more general `genericSplitAt`, in which n may be of any integral type.

Here are some examples:

{% highlight haskell %}
splitAt 6 "Hello World!" == ("Hello ","World!")
splitAt 3 [1,2,3,4,5] == ([1,2,3],[4,5])
splitAt 1 [1,2,3] == ([1],[2,3])
splitAt 3 [1,2,3] == ([1,2,3],[])
splitAt 4 [1,2,3] == ([1,2,3],[])
splitAt 0 [1,2,3] == ([],[1,2,3])
splitAt (-1) [1,2,3] == ([],[1,2,3])
{% endhighlight %}

Knowing this, now I can set up my mergeSort

{% highlight haskell %}
let n = length fileInput
let halfway = n `div` 2
let (a,b) = splitAt halfway fileInput
{% endhighlight %}
