Things that I learn about Haskell (and specifically front end web development with ReflexFRP) this week:

* Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is based on recognizing events, behaviors, and dynamics. ReflexFRP's [quickref page][1] shows you how the functions look like, where `t` is the *timeline* of which events behaviors and dynamics happen. Of the other the 3, I'm still trying to sort out which is constant, which is reactive, and so on. 
* Reflex-Dom has a base unit so most of the functions require a `$ return ()` to compile. The code basically says return an empty unit.. here are the main examples I've used this:
    {% highlight haskell %}
    elClass "div" "box" $ return ()
    elClass "button" "widget" $ text "Click me"{% endhighlight %}
* Variables are defined with `let x = "value"` whereas monads require binding with the left arrow, `x <- somefunction`
    {% highlight haskell %}
    let h = "Hello World"
    x <- elClass "div" "stylename" $ text h {% endhighlight %}
* If your Aeson hookup returns `Nothing`, double check the type definitions because variables may have been mispelled or needs to be a Maybe type (JSON can sometimes pass an empty string or null value. I [blogged about][2] this experience last year, but didn't realize that mispelled variables names gives the same error!
* In a do block of haskell code, you don't have to explicitly define variable names for the last thing returned.
    {% highlight haskell %}
    a <- elDiv "parent" $ do 
        x <- elDiv "child" $ return ()
        y <- elDiv "child" $ return ()
        combineDyne (\x y -> customFunction x y) x y
    elDiv "parent" $
        dynText a {% endhighlight %}
