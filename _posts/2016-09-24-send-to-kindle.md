Got a tip from someone at NY Haskell for reading pdf files on a Kindle. I didn't like the Gumroad phone app so much, made it difficult to browse through pages and flip back and forth between chapter text and chapter exercises.

Amazon has a [send to kindle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/) service that lets you email yourself a pdf document directly to your device. 

So far it feels like an improvement. The kindle app has a bit more in the way of navigating through chapters, sections, pages, and bookmarks.
